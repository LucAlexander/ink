# INK
Ink is a heavily WIP language project. I am writing this entirely from my own head without consulting any theory on compilation strategies or literature on compiling specific features. This is largely a learning exercise, and a way for me to get much better at programming, so I dont want to know any solutions beforehand. I entirely intend to make this language my main personal project language, and to continuously improve it as I use it.
